# PRODIGY_CS_03
Here’s a Python program that assesses password strength based on several criteria: 
length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback to the user on whether the password is weak, moderate, or strong.

# Explanation:
assess_password_strength(password): This function calculates the score based on five criteria and appends specific feedback messages if a criterion isn’t met.
main(): It prompts the user for their password and then displays the strength along with any feedback to improve the password’s security.
